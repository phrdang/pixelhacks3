            <p> 
                
                Cybersecurity is the act of protecting networks, systems and programs from digital harm. Cyber attacks usually occur because attackers are trying to change or access important information. 
                A cyber security attack can lead to identity theft, and loss to a lot of important data.

                <h1 style = "color: darkblue;">Cybersecurity Threats</h1>
                <p>There are many different types of cybersecurity threats. The top 3 cybersecurity threats are:
                    <h3>Phishing</h3> 
                    Phising is the act of targeting someone through email, telephone or text message by acting to be from a business or institution to lure the target into giving them personal information.
                    Phishing emails are meant to attract you so that you will click on the link. Attackers can send amazingly unbelievable attention grabbing statements just to lure your attention. Next time you see an unbelievable statement, DO NOT CLICK ON IT. It is always better to be safe than sorry, and chances are that if it looks unbelievable than it most probably is. 
                    Some phishing emails will give you a sense of urgency to act fast on a deal. They might say things like there is 80% sale at Apple and there is limited time to get the deal. It is always best to ignore such type of emails, because of there actually was an 80% sale at Apple, it would most probably be shown on their website.  </p>
                    They might also show up as hyperlinks and attachments. Before clicking on a hyperlinking, make sure to read the hyperlink so that you know whether it is real or not. Attackers usually frame a popular website and misspell one letter to confuse the target. Also make sure to never click on attachments that are sent from senders that you don't know or that seem suspicious. These kinds of attachments usually contain viruses. 
                    <a href="http://www.phishing.org/what-is-phishing" target="_blank"> click here to see the source. </a> 
                
                    <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                    Ransomware is the act of malicious software taking over your computer and threating you. Attackers send attachments to the target hoping that they will click on the attachment and download it. Once the download is opened and downloaded, the attacker will take over the target's computer and encrypt over the target's files. At the end of this entire process the files that the attacker has can not be decrypted without a key that the attacker made. The attacker then holds a ransom for the target to get their files back.  </p>
                    How to avoid ransomware:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure to backup all of your files so that you will be able to restore them. Restoring files is the easiest way to regain access to your data</li>
                        <li>Never give your personal information when answering an email, phone call or text message. Attackers usually pose to be from a famous business or insitute in IT so before giving out your personal information contact your IT department if you get suspicious emails or phone calls.</li>
                        <li>Make sure to have a antivirus software and keep a strong firewall. Employ content scanning and filtering on your mail servers. Suspicious emails that contain attachments then can be blocked so that it no longer contains a threat.</li>
                        <li>If you are traveling, make sure to tell your IT Department so that you can use a trustworthy VPN. (Virtual Private Network) when you are using WiFi.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Man-in-the-middle attack</h3>
                    These types of attacks of occur when the man in middle sends the target an email posing to be from a business or institute that you use. They will ask you to put in your credentials so that you can log into the account. Once you sign in, you are handing over all of your personal information to the attacker. The man in the middle creates a website that looks like one that you use so that you would trust the website and log in.   
                    There are 7 types of man-in-the-middle attacks. They are:
                    <ul>
                        <li> IP Spoofing </li>
                        <li> DNS Spoofing </li>
                        <li> HTTPS Spoofing </li>
                        <li> SSL Hijacking </li>
                        <li> Email Hijacking</li>
                        <li> Wi-Fi eavesdropping </li>
                        <li> Stealing browser cookies </li>

        <h3>The Status Quo</h3>
        <p>The purpose of a password is the make sure that your account is secure
            and that only you have access to it. If you use simple passwords, you
            can be easily hacked. Most people don't really put this into perspective,
            so here's <a href="https://www.betterbuys.com/estimating-password-cracking-times/" target="_blank">some statistics</a>:
            With a brute force attack, it would take a hacker:

        <p>
            According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption#Types" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, 
            "encryption is the process of encoding a message or information 
            in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot."
            <br>
            <br>
            Essentially, that's a fancy way to say that it takes data from the user and
            turns it into a code that can't be deciphered without an <b>encryption key</b>.
            That way, even if a hacker breaks into your device (such as your phone or laptop)
            they won't have access to your information because it's encrypted.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>You've probably used encrypted devices without even knowing it!</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Many password managers offer encryption to protect your password databases</li>
                <li>iPhones are automatically encrypted</li>
                <li>Many businesses and universities use encryption</li>
            </ul>
        
            <b>Types of Encryption Algorithms</b>
            <ul>
                <li>AES</li>
                <li>Triple DES</li>
                <li>RSA</li>
