        <h1>What is cybersecurity?</h1>
        <p> Cybersecurity is the act of protecting networks, systems and programs from digital harm. Cyber attacks usually occur because attackers are trying to change or access important information. 
        A cyber security attack can lead to identity theft, and loss to a lot of important data. 
        <p>Cybersecurity helps secure all of your information, and it helps make the internet safe from cyber attackers. </p>
        </p>
        <h1>Different types of cybersecurity threats</h1>
        <p>There are many different types of cybersecurity threats. The top 5 cybersecurity threats are:
        <p> 1)Phishing : 
        <p> Phising is the act of targeting someone through email, telephone or text message by acting to be from a business or institution to lure the target into giving them personal information.
        <p> Phishing emails are meant to attract you so that you will click on the link. Attackers can send amazingly unbelievable attention grabbing statements just to lure your attention. Next time you see an unbelievable statement, DO NOT CLICK ON IT. It is always better to be safe than sorry, and chances are that if it looks unbelievable than it most probably is. 
        <p> Some phishing emails will give you a sense of urgency to act fast on a deal. They might say things like there is 80% sale at Apple and there is limited time to get the deal. It is always best to ignore such type of emails, because of there actually was an 80% sale at Apple, it would most probably be shown on their website.  </p>
        <p> They might also show up as hyperlinks and attachments. Before clicking on a hyperlinking, make sure to read the hyperlink so that you know whether it is real or not. Attackers usually frame a popular website and misspell one letter to confuse the target. Also make sure to never click on attachments that are sent from senders that you don't know or that seem suspicious. These kinds of attachments usually contain viruses.
