        <p>
            According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption#Types" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, 
            "encryption is the process of encoding a message or information 
            in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot."
            <br>
            <br>
            Essentially, that's a fancy way to say that it takes data from the user and
            turns it into a code that can't be deciphered without an <b>encryption key</b>.
            That way, even if a hacker breaks into your device (such as your phone or laptop)
            they won't have access to your information because it's encrypted.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>You've probably used encrypted devices without even knowing it!</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Many password managers offer encryption to protect your password databases</li>
                <li>iPhones are automatically encrypted</li>
                <li>Many businesses and universities use encryption</li>
            </ul>
        
            <b>Types of Encryption Algorithms</b>
            <ul>
                <li>AES</li>
                <li>Triple DES</li>
                <li>RSA</li>
                <li>Blowfish</li>
                <li>Twofish</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><class>header</class>try it out!</h3>    
            <p>Enter some text below, and we'll encode it in a Caesar cipher,
                where every letter or number is shifted by a certain amount,
                which you can specify below.
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, if I wanted to "encrypt" the string "abcd" and shift
                it by 1 letter, the encoded string would be "bcde."
                <form>
                    <label>Type in text to "encrypt":</label>
                    <br>
                    <input type="text" name="encrypt-this">
                    <input type="submit" value="submit">
                </form>
                <br>
                <b>Encoded result</b>
                <br>
                <p id="encrypt-output"></p>
                <br>
                The Caesar cipher is a simple way to encode something,
                but real-life encryption is much harder to crack using
                brute force which makes it secure!
