                    In today's world, we have accounts for everything--email, social media,
                    banking, learning, you name it. If they can, criminals will take advantage
                    of these systems to get your personal information and money. To avoid that, we created PSYBER
                    to educate the public about the importance of cybersecurity and ways to stay safe 
                    when navigating the web.

                    The internet is not just made up of
                    computers and machines, it's made of the people
                    using it. At PSYBER, we believe that we need to change people's <em>mindsets</em>
                    (hence "<b>PSY</b>BER") so that they take steps to make the internet secure.
